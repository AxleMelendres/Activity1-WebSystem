        <h1 class="title">Nico Robin: The Archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates</h1>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
             <strong class="text-format">Nico Robin</strong> raised in Ohara, home of the world's oldest and largest library. Robin becomes an <bold class="text-format">archaeologist</bold> at the age of eight.
              At some point she gains the power of the Paramecia-type <mark class="text-format">Flower-Flower Fruit</mark> ( <em>Hana Hana No Mi</em>), which allows her body, including her eyes and ears,
              which spring up on surface near her.
            </p>
            <p>
                Behind her teachers' backs, she acquires from them the outlawed knowledge of how to translate the ancient stones called <bold>Poneglyphs</bold>, which are scattered around the world.
                She comes to share their goal of finding elusive Real <sup class="text-format">Ponegliff</sup>, which is said to tell the world's lost history referred to as the 100-Year Void ( <em> Void Century</em> )
            </p>
            <p>
               However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends a battlefleet to stop them.
               Only Robin escapes the devastating attack that claims the lives of the island's entire population, including that of her mother.
               Called <del class="text-format">"Devil Child"</del> ( <em>Akuma no Ko</em>), traumatized, and with a bounty on her head, Robin lives a life on the run, unable to trust anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                To survive, she cooperates with various pirates and other outlaws. She eventually joins <ins>Sir Crocodile's Baroque Works</ins> group, using the codename <strong>"Ms. All-Sunday" </strong>and becomes their vice-president.
                 After Baroque Works falls apart, with nowhere else to go, she tags along with the Straw Hat Pirates
                and grows so fond of them that she gives herself up to the Government to save them.
            </p>

            <p>
                After they discover her real reason for leaving, the <bold class="text-format">Straw Hat Pirates</bold> declare open war against the Government to get her back.
                 She realizes that she has finally found people who will never betray her and joins the crew.
                 Two years later, Robin further hones her Devil Fruit powers to the point she can create a full-bodied duplicate of herself.
